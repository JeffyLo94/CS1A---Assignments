Modify assignment #4 as follows: 
 1 – allow the user to specify an output file (as well as the input file). Allow the user the option 
 	to use a default file. 
 2 – Display a menu (see the screen output for specifics) -> loop until the user enters 0. 
 3 – the user should be able to output the entire list (like in Assignment #6, except the format 
 	for the output has changed) -> write a function that outputs one line at a time. 
 4 – the user should be able to search for a movie by title. 
 	The title should output all the information about the movie formatted like Assignment #6. 
 	Be sure to incorporate a word wrap function. 
	-> See the sample output file. 
 5 – the user should be able to search for a movie by genre, actor, rating or year. 
 	All of these searches will be formatted similarly -> see the output file for an example. 
	-> For genre, the search should output all the movies that have that genre specified for 
		either the genre or the alternate genre. 
	-> For actor, the search should output all of the movies that have the actor appear either 
		in a leading or supporting role. 
	-> For year, the search should output all movies that were released that year. 

Other requirements 
- USE AN ENUMERATED TYPE FOR THE MENU OPTIONS. 
- The searches should be performed using one search function. 
- Use appropriate types within the struct (i.e. year and rating should be numerical values -> 
	not strings). 
- Use appropriate selection statements to specify the different code segments based on the 
	menu option selected. 
- You will need to add several functions for this assignment – be sure you are using functions 
	properly -> keep them small! Print Heading should output to the screen and the file. 
 
Some suggestions: 
- Code Incrementally 
	-> Coding will be easier if you code 1 function at a time 
	->and test each function when you complete it. 
- Use detailed cout statements or the debugger in eclipse to trace variables. 
- You may want to start testing with the smaller input file provided for assignment #4.
